# Optimizing Retail Inventory Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a smart inventory optimization system for retail businesses using machine learning. The solution analyzes past sales, demand trends, and stock levels to predict future inventory needs, helping retailers reduce overstock and stockouts while increasing profitability.

## Problem Statement

Retailers face challenges in managing their inventory effectively due to unpredictable demand, seasonal changes, and lack of data-driven insights. This often leads to:
- Overstocking, causing waste and extra holding costs.
- Stockouts, resulting in missed sales and unhappy customers.

## Our Solution

We propose an ML-based inventory management system that:
- Analyzes historical sales and demand trends.
- Predicts future stock requirements for each product.
- Recommends optimal stock levels to maintain.
- Visualizes inventory and sales data for better decisions.

## Key Features

- Sales data analysis
- Predictive inventory planning
- Real-time dashboard
- Reduction of stockouts and overstock
- Easy integration with existing systems

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js 
-Backend: Node.js (Express) 
-Database: MongoDB 
-AI/ML Models: Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for demand forecasting 
-Cloud & Deployment: AWS (EC2, S3) / Firebase for hosting 
-Other Tools: GitHub for version control, Figma for UI/UX design 

## Impact

This system empowers retailers to:
- Make data-driven stocking decisions
- Reduce losses due to unsold inventory
- Ensure products are always available to customers
- Improve overall supply chain efficiency
